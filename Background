Since in the short term we just wanted to get the XML Spectacle data
out of the Microsoft Access XML, we went with REXML SAX2 xml stream
parser due to it's inclusion in ruby 1.8+. However nokogiri and libxml
(c-based) backed xml libraries could be faster if we find ourselves
doing it very often or with large data sets.

Would be interesting to try and create an active record and/or the
active migration based on the XML Schema document, creating a parser
that would load the resulting database. Ahhh.... but no time for
elegance at the moment.
